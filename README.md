# SmartLearningTool
SmartLearningTool is a beginner-friendly Python-based educational application designed to help users improve their understanding of the basics of the C programming language. It features a simple GUI interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to ask questions and receive intelligent answers powered by a machine learning model (TF-IDF + Naive Bayes).

The tool starts with basic questions and optionally presents advanced-level questions. If users find the advanced questions challenging, the app also offers helpful resources through external links.

This project combines Python, Tkinter, and machine learning techniques to provide an interactive and supportive learning experience for C language beginners.
